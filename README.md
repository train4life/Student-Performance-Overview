# Student-Performance-Overview
Analyzed 6.6k rows to find Exam_Score drivers. In MySQL, I manually coded Pearson’s Correlation to rank variables. Used Python (Pandas) for feature importance and Tableau for an Equity Gap dashboard mapping Teacher_Quality vs. Income. Results identified Tutoring as the top lever for high-risk students, turning raw data into an impact roadmap.

Project OverviewThis project analyzes a dataset of 6,600 students to identify the most significant drivers of academic achievement. By integrating a full data stack—SQL, Python, and Tableau—I transformed raw educational data into actionable insights focused on Instructional Equity.The analysis moves beyond static reporting to identify "High-Leverage Factors," determining which interventions (like tutoring) have the highest impact on student growth across various socioeconomic segments.Tech Stack & Methodology1. SQL (MySQL): Data Engineering & Statistical ModelingI orchestrated the data layer by performing ETL and manual statistical engineering. Since MySQL lacks a native CORR() function, I implemented the Pearson Correlation Coefficient formula within complex CTEs. This allowed me to rank features like Hours_Studied and Parental_Involvement by their statistical strength relative to Exam_Score.Key Logic Implemented:Manual Pearson’s $r$ calculation for feature ranking.Window Functions (RANK, PERCENT_RANK) for peer-group benchmarking.Conditional logic to create Socioeconomic_Status tiers.2. Python: Statistical Validation & HeatmapsI utilized Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature importance ranking.Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.Analysis: Generated correlation heatmaps to visualize multi-collinearity and used Random Forest Regressors to identify non-linear predictors of student success.3. Tableau: Instructional Equity DashboardThe final phase involved building an interactive dashboard designed for educational stakeholders.Visualizations: Equity Gap scatter plots, Teacher Quality impact heatmaps, and Risk Matrix quadrants.Functionality: Interactive filters for School_Type, Gender, and Learning_Disabilities to allow for granular equity deep-dives.Key InsightsThe Tutoring Lever: For "High Risk" students, tutoring sessions showed a 0.72 correlation with score improvement—the highest ROI of any supplemental intervention.Teacher Impact: High-quality teaching was found to "decouple" the typical link between low family income and low exam scores, highlighting the importance of teacher placement equity.Attendance Threshold: Analysis identified a critical "performance cliff" at the 80% attendance mark, where scores dropped significantly regardless of other resource factors.
