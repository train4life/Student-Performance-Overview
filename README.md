# Student-Performance-Overview
Analyzed 6.6k rows to find Exam_Score drivers. In MySQL, I manually coded Pearson’s Correlation to rank variables. Used Python (Pandas) for feature importance and Tableau for an Equity Gap dashboard mapping Teacher_Quality vs. Income. Results identified Tutoring as the top lever for high-risk students, turning raw data into an impact roadmap.
